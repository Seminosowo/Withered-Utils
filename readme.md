# FAQ

| Question | Awnser |
|----------|---------|
| It's crashing on mobile using x launcher! | Due to sodium, immediately fast, and many more advanced render mods, the modpack will not work on any render. Currently known working renders are [MobileGlues](https://github.com/MobileGL-Dev/MobileGlues-release) and LTW. |
| For how long are minecraft versions supported? | Usally, it's until the next major upgrade gets into the release state. |
| Pre configured? | Yes. the modpack is fully pre-configured for best performance and QOL features. |
